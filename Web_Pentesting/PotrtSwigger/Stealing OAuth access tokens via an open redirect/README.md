# Stealing OAuth access tokens via an open redirect
### Introduction
 - **Open redirect vulnerability** occurs when an application allows a user to control a redirect or forward to another URL. 
 - **OAuth** is used as a way for internet users to give websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords(like when you sign into an application with Google Login).
### Steps:

- Run Burp suite (Burp can capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver)

- Login with the given user name : wiener and password : peter and give acess to profile and email

- let's go to the burp to see GET /auth?client_id=[...] request and send it to Repeater.

then let's use directory traversal(Directory traversal  is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application)
