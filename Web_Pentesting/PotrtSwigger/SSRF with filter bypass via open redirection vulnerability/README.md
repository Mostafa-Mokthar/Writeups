### Introduction

 - **Open redirect vulnerability** occurs when an application allows a user to control a redirect or forward to another URL. 
 - **Server-side request forgery**(also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to        make requests to an unintended location passwords(like when you sign into an application with Google Login).

### Steps:

- Run Burp suite (Burp can capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver)

- i found redirect in this url:
   " https://0aca004403fde39cc0046f8b002c00cd.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=1 "

- i found it by trying to go to google.com by changing the last url to be:
   " https://0aca004403fde39cc0046f8b002c00cd.web-security-academy.net/product/nextproduct?path=https://google.com "
  **and it's working**

- so let's go to the burp and see the stock

- let's take this url in repeater and change the stockApi to the url shown in figure ( **we used the redirect vuln. we found before to go the required      path**)

  so we are redirected to admin page and see the the users.
 - and finally, let's do what we did before by changing the stockApi to delet user carlos as shown in the last figures:
